# Thirsty Plants

Thirsty Plants is coded in JavaScript using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) game framework, but it was initially developed in C# using the [Unity](https://unity3d.com) game engine. The Unity version can be found on the [`unity` branch](https://github.com/polarstoat/thirsty-plants/tree/unity).
